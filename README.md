# Hello-world
Hello, my name is Paulo I have done my degree in Computer Science in 2012. I have a Post Degree in Public Health Management. I am Python PCEP-30-01 Certified. 

I have worked in many sectors of IT. When I finished my degree I started work as an IT Instructor where I used to teach programming logic, windows tools especially office 365, database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLServer).

Between 2013 and 2020 I worked in the Health Public Sector as a Systems Analyst/Support Analyst.
At the end of 2019, I returned to work as an IT Instructor for the Senai School (one of the most respected technical schools in Brazil).

In the beginner of 2020, I went to Ireland to improve my English knowledge. I am taking the opportunity to focus on a long-standing desire to work with system development. So I started my studies in Python to became a specialist in Python. I just got my first certification PCEP-30-01 and I am now preparing for the second one and so on.
